# CarRally!

CarRally! is a thrilling 2D car racing game developed using Python and Pygame. Players navigate through challenging tracks, avoid tumbling and competing to the computer car(Bot). As you go to the higher levels the game gets even tougher. With smooth controls and dynamic gameplay, CarRally! offers an exciting experience for both casual and competitive gamers.

# Objective

The objective of CarRally! is to create an exciting and competitive 2D racing game using Python and Pygame, where the player races against an AI-controlled car across 10 levels. 
As the levels progress, the speed of the AI car increases, adding difficulty and enhancing the challenge. 
The game aims to test the player's reflexes and strategy while providing an engaging and fun experience through progressively tougher gameplay.

# Technology

VsCode: The Python extension makes Visual Studio Code an excellent Python editor.
Python: The core programming language used for game logic, structure, and functionality.
Pygame: A Python library used for building the game, handling graphics, sounds, and user inputs.
Collision Detection: Techniques used to manage interactions between player car, AI car, and obstacles.
Timers and Event Handling: For managing game pace, level progression, and controlling the AI car's increasing speed across levels.

# Output

Initially the game will look like this, after pressing any key the game will begin.

And so on the game will become tougher on increasing levels

# Setup

Simple setup required for this project:
Download the zip file of the project and unzip it.
Open the project in VsCode.
Install the pygame package of python in the VsCode code.
The command for installing pygame is "pip install pygame" runit in the terminal and then run the project.

# Thoughts

The increasing difficulty across 10 levels adds a sense of progression and challenge, keeping players motivated to improve their skills. As the computer car becomes faster, it pushes players to adapt and become more strategic in their racing. With varying levels of difficulty, players will likely return to beat their previous times or outdo the computer car(Bot) in higher levels, enhancing replay value.
